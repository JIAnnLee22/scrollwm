ScrollWM

This readme is in desperate need of update.  The previous message suggested scrollwm was not ready for normal use.  I have now been using it as my sole WM on two computers for several weeks and it is working very well (for me).

I will next work on putting together a decent readme and man page.  But for now feel free to check in the thread on bbs.archlinux.org

ScrollWM

This is currently at the concept stage only.  Do not expect this to do anything remotely useful as a WM yet.

Mod4+mouse button 1 or 3 drag to move or resize a window.

Mod4+Mod1+mouse button 1 drag to move the desktop

Mod4+mouse button 2 to fit a window to the viewport (aka "maximize")

Mod4+Enter launch urxvt
Mod4+w launch luakit
Mod4+p launch dmenu

That's it.
